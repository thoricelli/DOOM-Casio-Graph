We have 256 kb free of memory at 88040000 :D!

https://bible.planet-casio.com/lephenixnoir/en/sh7305/calc/memory

RAM: 256kb
(
    actually 512kb, but we don't want to mess with the OS. 
    Hopefully find a way to get rid of all timers? 
    So we can make use of it.
    Find a way not to override our own program tho...
)

500kb of ROM mapped virtual memory
(4 mb total ROM, 2.5+ in use by OS.)
30kb of user memory

On chip memory (aka f*cking fast)
ILRAM: 4kb
XRAM: 8kb
YRAM: 8kb
TOT: 20kb

SPU (Sound Processing Unit) (only allows 32bit reads)
PRAM0: 160kb (Continuous)
XRAM0: 168kb (Not continuous)
YRAM0: 48 kb (Not continuous)
PRAM1: 160kb (Continuous)
XRAM1: 168kb (Not continiuous)
YRAM1: 48kb (Not continiuous)

Total (non fragmented memory): 320kb
Total SPU memory: 752kb

Options:

Usable (non-ROM and non-fragmented) memory: 606kb
or
Usable (non-ROM) memory: 1mb
or
Usable (virtual) memory: 1.5mb

If we can map more from ROM, that adds another 1.5 mb (at least thats whats available for my calc) for a total of 4mb.

Squashed Level 1 DOOM: 667kb.
Full DOOM: 3.8mb.

Maybe change the WAD so the sprites aren't big, we don't need all the color data, only grey bmp data anyways.
Check how much we can decrease the size of that by.
Maybe we can even hardcode the sprites and assets? Instead of reading lumps from the WAD file.
Although, a seperate file might be handy since we only have access to 500kb of userspace ROM.
